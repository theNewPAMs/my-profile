        <p> I will like to think of my self as a <strong><em>social innovator</em></strong>. I use the skills and knowledge I obtain from Varsity and every where I've been to solve some of the social issues in my community. This issues mostly are mostly centered around education, as I believe that education is the most powerful weapon you can use to change the world - <em>Nelson Mandela</em></p>
        
        <h3>SciLab ABC</h3>
        <p>SciLab ABC is a lab that we build in my community using old computer. This lab uses old computers from companies and people which they were thinking of throwing away. To make sure that they are still efficent, we installed linux OS on them. The nice thing about linux dest is that is is openSource.</p>
          
        <h3>Beyond Class Room Project</h3>
        <p>This is a project that we started recently. Bacause of the lack of resources in small communities, which results in lack of skills amongst our youth who cant afford post-matric education, we have started a project where we teach the youth in small communities skills that we learn in varsity. This includes programming and how to use some of the technical softwares such as Revit.</p>
